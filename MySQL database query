The college library is quite visibly one such sphere. The dedicated library block situated over an area of 1300 sq.ft is a fully automated and engaging facility of the college. We have a capacity of 250 which allows students to utilize the library all through the day for as long as they want, and with whatever capacity they intend.\r\n\r\nThe SDMIT library is a member of the VTU Consortium, which means that the students have free access to academic materials directly sanctioned by the VTU and most of them not available elsewhere. The library is also a member of Delnet, and of NDL (National Digital Library) which expand the availability of quality reading material to an unmatched level. We also have D-space digital library systems incorporated which allow students to access question papers, notes and projects from previous academic years without restrictions.\r\n\r\nThe library keeps track of library usage by students through bar code tracking, through which best users of the library are chosen every month and given recognition. The fully automated setup allows us to keep perfect track of borrowing and returning facilities which are highly utilized by our students. Evidently, the SDMIT library is amongst the busiest places within the campus.

The term Ayurveda is derived from the Sanskrit words ayur (life) and veda (science or knowledge). Thus, Ayurveda translates to knowledge of life. Based on the idea that disease is due to an imbalance or stress in a person\'s consciousness, Ayurveda encourages certain lifestyle interventions and natural therapies to regain a balance between the body, mind, spirit, and the environment.\n\nAyurveda treatment starts with an internal purification process, followed by a special diet, herbal remedies, massage therapy, yoga, and meditation.\n\nThe concepts of universal interconnectedness, the body\'s constitution (prakriti), and life forces (doshas) are the primary basis of ayurvedic medicine. Goals of treatment aid the person by eliminating impurities, reducing symptoms, increasing resistance to disease, reducing worry, and increasing harmony in life. Herbs and other plants, including oils and common spices, are used extensively in Ayurvedic treatment. \n\nIn India, Ayurveda is considered a form of medical care, equal to conventional Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, naturopathic medicine, and homeopathic medicine. Practitioners of Ayurveda in India undergo state-recognized, institutionalized training. Currently, Ayurvedic practitioners are not licensed in the United States, and there is no national standard for Ayurvedic training or certification. However, Ayurvedic schools have gained approval as educational institutions in some states.  \n\nAyurveda can have positive effects when used as a complementary therapy in combination with standard, conventional medical care.\n\nMany Ayurvedic materials have not been thoroughly studied in either Western or Indian research. Some of the products used in Ayurvedic medicine contain herbs, metals, minerals, or other materials that may be harmful if used improperly or without the direction of a trained practitioner. Ayurvedic medicines are regulated as dietary supplements rather than as drugs in the United States, so they are not required to meet the safety and efficacy standards for conventional medicines. These medicines can interact, or work against, the effects of Western medicines. Investigate the training and background of Ayurvedic practitioners whom you intend to use.\n\nIt\'s important to discuss any Ayurvedic treatments that you use with your doctor. Women who are pregnant or nursing, or people who are thinking of using Ayurvedic therapy to treat a child, should consult their healthcare provider. It is important to make sure that any diagnosis of a disease or condition has been made by a healthcare provider who has substantial conventional medical training and experience with managing that disease or condition. While Ayurveda can have positive effects when used as a complementary therapy in combination with standard, conventional medical care, it should not replace standard, conventional medical care, especially when treating serious conditions.

It‚Äôs a granted fact that students, when they leave college, reminiscence student life with possibly any other relevant factor except academics.\r\n\r\nBy popular opinion, SDMIT has a central (quite literally) attraction factor that has always been the key to keeping the visual memory of the college intact. Just as you enter the building, you‚Äôre in for a surprise as there stands a large tree atop a hill within the campus.\r\n\r\nYes you read it right ‚Äì within the campus. Apparently, when the campus was being constructed, the hill and the tree atop it formed a magnificent sight, which our President Dr. D Veerendra Heggade decided shall be kept intact. Hence the tree and the hill were made the central structure around which the campus was constructed. And until today, even after 11 years, the ‚ÄòOne tree hill‚Äô in the midst of the campus stands tall, stretching up to the topmost floor of the building. Inevitably, it makes for a picturesque factor that shall easily be the factor influencing most visual memories associated with the college. After all, most students spend time staring at the beautiful monsoon sights the tree hill makes for when lessons seem to be passing atop their heads! Regardless, SDMIT is proud and endeared by this factor which clearly sets the infrastructure apart from the rest of our kind. \r\n\r\n', '31-7-2021', 'http://192.168.43.84/parentportal/images/blogposts/studentposts/studentimage1.jpg');
